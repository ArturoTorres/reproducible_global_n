## Goal

-   Following the indications, the goal of this reproducible code is to (IIASA-BNR, 2023, assignment):

    -   "Combine various datasets to generate indictors of nitrogen loss to the environment associated with wheat production at various spatial scales"

    -   "Provide graphical representations and conduct simple comparisons across a few countries"

    -   "Provide a reproducible code associated to these tasks."
